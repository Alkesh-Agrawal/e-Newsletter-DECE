        <h2 class="sub-head-text">
          Innovation Ambassadors are highly motivated professionals who have a
          keen interest in social entrepreneurship and want to support Big
          Ideas’ mission to help this generation of students develop social
          impact projects that matter to them. Innovation Ambassadors are
          responsible for Big Ideas outreach, event organization, advising, and
          research on their campus. Ultimately, they help aspiring student
          entrepreneurs transform their ideas into viable ventures.

          IICs at institutes are envisioned an instrumental role to drive
          innovation and startup ecosystem at campus while connecting with
          ecosystem enablers at regional and national level. For this, the role
          of faculty being a member of IIC is very important to play as a mentor
          or guide young minds in their pursuit of Innovation and
          entrepreneurship and equally crucial for mentors to have the adequate
          mentoring skills. Considering the fact that Indian HEIs are lacking in
          innovation and start-up mentor capacity to guide students on IPR,
          Innovation and Entrepreneurship, Institutions Innovation council of
          MoE’s Innovation Cell aims to build mentorship capacity of IIC members
          through a series of training programs and designate the trained IIC
          members as "IIC - Innovation Ambassador".
